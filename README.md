# React Router Boilerplate 

### React + Vite + React Router Library + Minimal CSS

Welcome, Technigo students! This boilerplate is designed specifically for you. We understand the importance of a smooth start, especially when diving into libraries like React Router. With this in mind, we've crafted an out-of-the-box solution to help you seamlessly integrate the router library into your projects.

### NO CSS Boiler Plate

If you want a cleaner version of this boiler plate with no css, please go to the following link:

</a>

## Original Features:

- **Vite Integration:** Experience the speed and efficiency of Vite, ensuring your React projects are lightning-fast.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** No more manual reloads. With HMR, see your changes in real-time as you code.

## Custom Integrations:

- **React Router:** React Router is an external library for React that provides routing capabilities. It allows developers to create multi-page applications within React, enabling navigation between different components without reloading the entire page.

## Getting Started with the Project

### 1. **Clone the Repository**:
First, you'll need to get a copy of the repository on your local machine. You can do this using git. There are three common methods to clone a repository: USing the gitHub CLI, HTTPS and SSH.

#### 1.1. **Using HTTPS**:
This is the default method and works universally. Simply copy the HTTPS URL from the repository's main page and use the following command:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/Technigo/react-router-boiler-plate-minimal-css.git
```

#### 1.2. **Using SSH**:
For those who have set up SSH keys with GitHub, this method provides a secure way without needing to enter your credentials every time. First, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh ">
ensure you've set up SSH keys with GitHub
</a>  . Then, copy the SSH URL from the repository's main page and use the following command:


```bash
git@github.com:Technigo/react-router-boiler-plate-minimal-css.git
```

#### 1.3. **Using Github CLI**:
If you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed, you can easily clone the repository and even perform many other GitHub operations directly from the command line. To clone the repository using GitHub CLI, use the following command:

```bash
gh repo clone Technigo/react-router-boiler-plate-minimal-css
```

### 2. **Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server**:
Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The below command is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev 
```

## Installing the React Library

React Router is an essential library for routing in React applications. There are a couple of ways you can install it, depending on your project's needs.

For a straightforward installation of just the React Router library, you can use the following command. This is the command being applied to this boiler plate.

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

With this boilerplate, you're not just getting a template; you're getting a head start. Dive in and make the most of your learning journey with Technigo!

## Navigating through this repository

#### 1. **Routes Configuration (`src/routes/routes.jsx`)**:

This file is the heart of the routing system in this repository. It defines the paths and their associated components. Here's a quick look:

```jsx
import { Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "../pages/Home";
import About from "../pages/About";
import Contact from "../pages/Contact";

const routes = (
  <>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
  </>
);

export default routes;
```

#### 2. Pages Folder Structure:

These are the components that get rendered when you navigate to a specific route.

**Home (src/pages/Home.jsx):** This is the landing page. It provides a welcome message to Technigo students and offers some insights into the boilerplate's features.

**About (src/pages/About.jsx):** A simple about page with some placeholder text. It also displays some logos using the Logos component.

**Contact (src/pages/Contact.jsx):** Similar to the About page, it's a placeholder for contact information.

#### 3. Main App Component (src/App.jsx):

This is where the magic happens! The `BrowserRouter` wraps our entire application, enabling the use of routing functionalities. Inside, you'll find a navigation bar with links to our defined routes and a Routes component that renders the appropriate page based on the current path.

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Link, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import routes from "./routes/routes";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <main>
        <Routes>{routes}</Routes>
      </main>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

##### Understanding the React Router Syntax

- **`<BrowserRouter>`**: This is the wrapping component that provides the foundation for all the routing functionalities. Think of it as the stage where all the routing magic happens!

- **`<nav>` and `<ul>`**: These are just standard HTML elements creating a navigation bar. Inside, we have a list (`<ul>`) of navigation items (`<li>`).

- **`<Link to="/">`**: This is where React Router starts to shine! The `<Link>` component is like your regular `<a>` tag in HTML, but supercharged. The `to` prop tells the browser where to navigate when the link is clicked. So, `<Link to="/">Home</Link>` will take you to the homepage.

- **`<Routes>{routes}</Routes>`**: This is the heart of our routing system. The `<Routes>` component is responsible for rendering the right component based on the current path. The `{routes}` inside is a collection of route definitions, telling our app which component to show for which path.

#### 4. Happy Coding !

And that's it! With just a few lines of code, you've set up a dynamic navigation system for your React app. Happy coding! ðŸš€
